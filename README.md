2. Anime-style transform 
3. Cancer segmentation from histological slides 
4. Rent/appartment price ratio - market price analysis for further investments (law complexity included) - EU/Worldwide  (https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_countries.jsp)
5. Tongue segmentation with deep learning (hsi or jpg, check japanese proj and some databases)
6. Stress measurement with pulsemeter
7. Anormal Behavior Detection in Crowds
8. Image generation using deep learning (for any purpose)
9. Unsupervised tracking of endoscopic tools in real-time
10. Increase pigmentation (wrinkles) in real time
11. Compare RMSE with other metrics (Colorimetric metrics, Spectral metrics, Metameric indexes,Weighted spectral metrics)
12. Emotion recognition from web camera.
13. Speech tone analysis (inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89FHXM2q36s)  IBM WATSON
14. Web pictures animation by Chrome plugin
15. Web plugin for item recognition from Youtube
16. Counterfereit production identification app 
17. Influencer analysis for collabs with brands (best match)
18. Tree leaf identification for foresters
19. Mimic recognition using deep learning 
20. Use screen of Iphone (calibrated) for imaging setup. Screen will show different colors and we can take a spectral image (spectral           reconstruction)
21. Receipt recommender (using ingredients)
